## Description

Paryatan is a comprehensive trip planning application designed to streamline the travel experience for users by leveraging heuristic algorithms to recommend tourist spots and create personalized itineraries. 

Paryatan's heuristic algorithm operates by meticulously analyzing multiple factors to craft a tailored travel itinerary. Leveraging the user's current location, personal preferences, and the specified trip duration, the algorithm dynamically assembles a well-balanced schedule that maximizes the exploration of diverse attractions. By incorporating geographical proximity, historical significance, and user-specific interests, Paryatan ensures that each day of the itinerary is finely tuned to provide a delightful and personalized travel experience.
